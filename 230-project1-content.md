## Fish in the Sea
The game of aquatic life and hunger. Play as a fish who's just really really hungry

#Proposal
##Proposal
### Elevator Pitch
It's feeding frenzy meets poor comic relief. In this deep sea game of a dog eat dog world avoid the big fish while mercilessly devouring
smaller fish in an ultimately futile attempt to become the biggest fish in the sea.

###Genre
I really don't know what genre Feeding Frenzy fits under, it's basically a flash game but had production value. 
The tags I see fitting this game are: Aquatic, Frenzy, Avoidance 

###Platform
Desktop Only, unless I have time and conviction, in which case it would be mobile friendly.

###Story
Play as Gerald, a pipsqueak who wants to rule the ocean. He's decided there's only one way to do this: devour everyone who
is smaller than him to gain their strength and become bigger. Join Gerald on his journey to become the biggest fish in the sea.

###AestheticsTM
Think of Feeding Frenzy but with a twinge more cartoony and a lot more not kid friendly. The idea is that as Gerald gets bigger the
game evolves from a frenzy game to a slaughter, ramping up the nore gruesome aspects of life.
