# Main Page
## Fish in the Sea
![Banner](https://github.com/MCCapra/IGME-230/blob/master/fishBanner.png "Banner")
The game of aquatic life and hunger. Play as a fish who wants to be at the top of the food chain, and can't wait to eat his way there.

# Proposal
### Elevator Pitch
It's feeding frenzy meets poor comic relief. In this deep sea game of a dog eat dog world avoid the big fish while mercilessly devouring
smaller fish in an ultimately futile attempt to become the biggest fish in the sea.

### Genre
Fish in the Sea is a game of fish, food chains, and asserting your dominance. This cartoon frenzy of fish will have you running amuck
trying to feed as much as possible before being eaten yourself.

### Platform
Desktop Only, unless I have time and conviction, in which case it would be mobile friendly.

### Story
Play as Gerald, a pipsqueak who wants to rule the ocean. He's decided there's only one way to do this: devour everyone who
is smaller than him to gain their strength and become bigger. Join Gerald on his journey to become the biggest fish in the sea.

### AestheticsTM
Think of Feeding Frenzy but with a twinge more cartoony and a lot more not kid friendly. The idea is that as Gerald gets bigger the
game evolves from a frenzy game to a slaughter, ramping up the more gruesome aspects of life.
